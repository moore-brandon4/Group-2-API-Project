# Group-2-API-Project

API for reference: https://pokeapi.co/

Heroku: https://group2-apiproject.herokuapp.com/

This website receives information from the PokeAPI database, and displays it on the webpage.

It works on the front end by allowing the user to select and submit a number 1-876.
Then, the page displays a list array of information about that particular pokemon.

On the back end, the user input from the form is stored as a variable acts as the last parameter of the url.
This url is sent to the PokeAPI database and the database returns a json with the information of that particular pokemon.
That json data is what is displayed after the user submits their number.
